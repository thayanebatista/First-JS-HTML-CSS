# First JS/HTML/CSS
    - My first js/html/css code using themoviedb api, sorry any code that seems strange, it's realy my 1st time doing it. 
# What this project can do?
    - search movies
    - see highlight movies 
    - see synopsis by passing mouse 
    - see trailers (one or more) from the movie select 
# What this project can't do(yet)?
    - login with your themoviedb account 
    - see your fave movies
    - see or put films in 'watch list' 

# How do I use it? 
    - for now, just start the 'index.html' file. When it's finished, you gonna use your login and pass from themoviedb to see your watchlist
